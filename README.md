CS1520-Project: PeopleSofter
============

This web application's aim is to help students schedule classes with a more intuitive interface than Pitt's default course scheduling tool.  Future goals include pulling in data from rate my professors, minimizing distance between classes, and prioritizing classes during certain times.

However, Pitt's course catalog API is nonexistent, and Pitt's online cataolog often has incorrect or incomplete data.  This project is currently shelved due to lack of proper data.

You can find an initial mockup of the project here: http://pitt-course-scheduler.appspot.com/
